# Product Context

## Purpose

CodeScribe is a tool designed to:
1. Help understand and document code through automated descriptions
2. Test and improve code generation capabilities
3. Create learning examples through comparison of human and machine-written code

## Problem Statement

1. **Documentation Challenge**
   - Code often lacks clear descriptions
   - Manual documentation is time-consuming
   - Need for automated understanding

2. **Code Generation Quality**
   - Current generators need improvement
   - Learning from real examples is valuable
   - Iterative improvement is necessary

3. **Learning Gap**
   - Difference between human and machine code
   - Need for concrete examples
   - Value of comparison-based learning

## Solution

CodeScribe provides a workflow that:

1. **Automates Understanding**
   - Takes source files as input
   - Creates clear descriptions
   - Documents code purpose

2. **Improves Generation**
   - Uses descriptions to generate code
   - Compares with original implementation
   - Learns from differences

3. **Iterates Quality**
   - Shows differences to users
   - Incorporates feedback
   - Improves through examples

## Core Workflow

1. **Input Processing**
   - Accept source files
   - Create descriptions
   - Store structured data

2. **Code Generation**
   - Use descriptions
   - Generate implementations
   - Store by round

3. **Quality Improvement**
   - Compare versions
   - Get user feedback
   - Update system prompts

## Success Criteria
