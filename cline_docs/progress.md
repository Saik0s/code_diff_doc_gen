## Ready for Use
The core workflow is implemented:
1. Initialize workspace and LLM client
2. Process source files to create descriptions
3. Generate code from descriptions
4. Compare results and create examples
5. Update prompts for next round

## Next Steps
1. Testing
   - Add more test cases
   - Test full workflow
   - Add example cases
   - Document test scenarios

2. Documentation

   - Document CLI commands
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Create contribution guide

3. Improvements
   - Add more language support (currently Swift-focused)
   - Enhance error handling
   - Add configuration options
   - Improve prompt templates

No blockers. System is ready for testing and documentation.
