# Progress

## Done
- Initial planning and documentation
- Core structure defined and documented
- Tech stack selected and documented
- State persistence and LLM scoring planned and documented
- Basic project setup (files, dependencies, CLI structure, state management setup)
- CLI issues resolved (TypeError fixed)
- Added logging and UI requirements (loguru and rich)

## In Progress
- Implementing core pipeline stages (`split`, `describe`)
- Planning test suite for sample files in `tests/data` folder
- Setting up logging and UI infrastructure

## Next
1. Core Setup
   - [x] Project structure
   - [x] CLI interface
   - [ ] LLM connection
   - [ ] Logging configuration
   - [ ] Terminal UI setup

2. Features
   - [ ] Code splitting with progress tracking
   - [ ] Description generation with status updates
   - [ ] Code regeneration with feedback
   - [ ] Doc generation with progress bars
   - [ ] State Persistence with logging
   - [ ] LLM Scoring with metrics display

3. Logging and UI
   - [ ] Structured logging setup
   - [ ] Progress bar implementation
   - [ ] Status spinners
   - [ ] Error display formatting
   - [ ] Operation timing tracking
   - [ ] Resource usage monitoring

4. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests for code splitting logic
   - [ ] Integration tests for pipeline stages
   - [ ] State persistence tests
   - [ ] LLM interaction tests
   - [ ] Error handling tests
   - [ ] Logging verification tests
   - [ ] UI component tests

5. Test Planning
   - [ ] Create language-agnostic test suite
   - [ ] Define test patterns for different code structures
   - [ ] Plan integration tests for full pipeline
   - [ ] Design logging test scenarios
   - [ ] Create UI test cases

## Status
- Phase: Initial Setup and Core Pipeline
- Progress: 25%
- Focus: Core Pipeline Implementation & Test Planning
- Priority: Logging and UI Implementation
