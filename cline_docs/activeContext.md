# Active Context

## Current
- Project setup initiated
- Core structure defined and documented
- Dependencies selected and documented
- State persistence and LLM scoring planned and documented
- Basic placeholder files created (`cli.py`, `llm.py`, `parser.py`, `generator.py`, `state_manager.py`, `__init__.py`)
- `pyproject.toml` configured with dependencies and scripts
- Virtual environment created and dependencies installed
- Basic state loading logic implemented in `cli.py` with `--resume` flag
- **CLI execution issues still pending (TypeError and argument passing)**

## Next Steps
1. **Fix CLI execution issues (resolve `TypeError` and ensure arguments are passed correctly)**
2. Implement core pipeline stages (`split`, `describe`, `regenerate`, `document`) in respective modules.
3. Implement state persistence logic (saving and loading state at each pipeline stage).
4. Implement LLM scoring prompt and integration in `scorer.py` and `llm.py`.
5. Add basic tests for core functionality, state persistence, and LLM scoring.

## Timeline
- Day 1: Project setup, CLI, State Management Setup (Completed - extended due to setup issues)
- Day 2: Core pipeline (Split, Describe), State persistence
- Day 3: Documentation generation, LLM Scoring Implementation
- Day 4: Testing and polish
- Day 5: Contingency/Further Testing and Polish (added due to extended setup)
