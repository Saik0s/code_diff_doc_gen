# Active Context

## Current Status
- Test strategy planning in progress for sample code files
- Core testing requirements identified:
  - Code splitting validation
  - Pipeline stage integration
  - State persistence verification
  - Error handling coverage
  - Documentation accuracy verification
- Logging and UI requirements added:
  - Structured logging with loguru
  - Rich terminal UI components
  - Progress reporting system
  - Error display formatting
- CLI issues resolved (TypeError fixed)

## Next Steps
1. **Implement core pipeline stages with logging and UI feedback**
   - Add loguru setup and configuration
   - Implement rich progress bars and spinners
   - Add detailed operation logging
   - Create error display formatting

2. Implement state persistence with progress tracking
   - Add logging for state changes
   - Show progress during state operations
   - Implement error recovery feedback

3. Implement LLM operations with status updates
   - Add progress bars for LLM calls
   - Log prompt/response details
   - Show token usage statistics
   - Display cost estimates

4. Create test suite for sample code files:
   - Define test patterns for different code structures
   - Create test cases for core pipeline stages
   - Implement logging and UI tests
   - Add error handling test coverage

## Timeline
- Day 1: Project setup, CLI, State Management Setup (Completed)
- Day 2: Core pipeline (Split, Describe) with logging, State persistence
- Day 3: Documentation generation, LLM Scoring Implementation, UI components
- Day 4: Testing and polish
- Day 5: UI/UX improvements and final polish

## Test Suite Planning
1. Code Processing Tests
   - Test splitting of different code structures
   - Verify preservation of code context
   - Test handling of comments and documentation
   - Log all operations with timing

2. Pipeline Stage Tests
   - Verify accurate operation of each stage
   - Test progress reporting
   - Validate error handling
   - Monitor resource usage

3. UI/UX Tests
   - Test progress bar accuracy
   - Verify spinner animations
   - Check status message clarity
   - Test terminal resizing handling

4. Logging Tests
   - Verify structured logging
   - Test log levels and formatting
   - Check error tracebacks
   - Validate context preservation

5. Integration Tests
   - Test full pipeline execution
   - Verify state persistence
   - Test error recovery
   - Monitor overall performance
